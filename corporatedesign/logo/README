The logo is designed with Inkscape and uses layers with the "Screen" 
blend mode to create the interference effect of the rings. 
Unfortunately that only works in Inkscape, not in other SVG viewers. 
Export in another vector format didn't work at the time of writing. 
Attempts to flatten the image automatically or manually gave 
unsatisfactory results as well. For that reason one has to use the 
PNG version for most purposes.
